    <!-- dojo.js is an AMD-compliant loader script. It accepts configuration 
         either from a data-dojo-config attribute, as shown here, from a global 
         dojoConfig object (which must be defined *before* dojo.js is loaded),
         or from a global require object.

         Configuration options for the loader can be viewed at 
         http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/loader/amd.html
         along with a bunch of additional information about its features.

         Below, we’re doing the following:

         1. Enabling the AMD loader. (async: 1)
         2. Fixing the loader to use normal AMD resolution of unregistered 
            module paths (relative to baseDir) instead of the traditional Dojo 
            resolution method (relative to the parent of baseDir).
            (tlmSiblingOfDojo: 0)
         3. Enabling debugging. (isDebug: 1)

         The remainder of Dojo configuration, as well as our application’s 
         instantiation, occurs within app/run.js.

         NOTE: `build.sh` is responsible for removing the "isDebug" flag 
                when deploying to production. If you modify this flag at all,
                you will break the build!
    -->
    <script data-dojo-config="async: 1, tlmSiblingOfDojo: 0, isDebug: 1" src="dojo/dojo.js"></script>

    <!-- Load the loader configuration script. Note that this module ID is 
         hard-coded in build.sh in order to provide an optimised build that 
         loads as few as one script for the entire application. If you change 
         the name or location of this module, you will need to update build.sh
         too.
